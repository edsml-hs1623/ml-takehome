# Design Decisions & Trade-offs

## Architecture Choices

**Modular Service Design**: Separated concerns into distinct services (transcription, topic extraction, vectorization, matching) for maintainability and testability. This allows independent development and easier debugging.

**FastAPI Framework**: Chosen for its automatic API documentation, type validation, and async support. Provides excellent developer experience with built-in Swagger UI.

## Technical Trade-offs

**Whisper Model Selection**: Using `whisper-small` for balance between accuracy and performance. Could fallback to `whisper-tiny` for faster inference if needed.

**Topic Extraction**: KeyBERT with sentence-transformers provides better semantic understanding than traditional TF-IDF, though at higher computational cost.

**Vector Fusion**: Simple concatenation chosen over more complex fusion methods for interpretability and simplicity.

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching for model loading and add async processing
2. **Enhanced Matching**: Incorporate temporal dynamics and user interaction history
3. **Scalability**: Add Redis for caching and consider microservices architecture
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging, metrics, and health checks
5. **Data Pipeline**: Add batch processing capabilities for large-scale user matching
