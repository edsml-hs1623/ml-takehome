What what's next step after that is it an unmanned Voyage to Mars first. I'm an flight of Mars the Earth and Mars Orbit synchronize every two years or every 26 months technically so The next orbital synchronization is November of next year So and you can launch plus minus a month roughly so we'd have to launch in November or December of next year so the default plan is to launch hopefully several Starships to Mars at the end of next year And what would they be doing? Well at first we're just gonna try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing Do we succeed in landing like let's say we were able to send five ships do all five land intact or do we? Add some craters to Mars If we add some craters we've got to be But more cautious about sending people, you know, and we need to So we're gonna make sure the thing lands Safely how does it land on Mars with on rocket's restors? So it'll just land. Oh, well add legs. Okay. Yeah, we'll just land and have legs and yeah, so It'll be remote controlled from Earth Or just autonomous autonomous completely Mars is you can't remote control things from both because Mars. Yeah, it's too far speed of light you have speed of light constraints so Mars at closest approaches roughly four light minutes and When it's on the other side of the Sun it's it's about 12 light minutes, so you know round trip would be like 40 minutes best case if Mars is on the other side of the Sun So once you do that then how long do you think before you start sending people up there? Well, we're gonna try to go as fast as possible. You can think this is really Erase against time can we make Mars self-sufficient before Civilization has some sort of Future fork in the road where there's either like a war or nuclear war or something or a We'll get hit by a meteor Or or simply civilization might just die with a Womper in adult diapers instead of with a bang I Think we can do this and I don't know at least I think we do it within 15 Earth Mars Inquanization events or you know, so we select 30ish years If we have an exponential increase in If every year if every two years we're we have like a major increase in Number of people and tonished Mars like I think as a rough approximation We need about a million tons of the surface of Mars maybe a million people that kind of thing To actually have a civilization Yeah, the The would you terraform like what would you do you would eventually terraform Mars at first people would live in Some kind of protected environment like domes and underground kind of thing Terraforming would take too long I were at this point in time where In the for the first time in the four and a half billion year history of Earth It is possible to extend Consciousness beyond our home planet and That window may be open for long time or it may be open for a short time. I hope it's open for a long time but it might only be open for a short time and we just make sure that we extend the light of consciousness to Mars before Civilization either extinguishes or subsides You know, we'll let me let any Savon is that the technology level of Mars drops below or technology level of Earth drops below what is necessary to send space ships to Mars so If there's some really destructive war or like some natural cataclysm Or simply the birth rate is so low that you know here We're just like to die in In adult diapers with a one per that's one of the possible outcomes for a lot of countries ahead of that way By the way, so Japan is right? Japan Korea yeah, yeah, I mean at dangerously yeah at current birth rates in three generations Korea will be about 4% of its current size That's insane. Yeah, maybe maybe even less than that There they're only at one third replacement rate so if you if you have three generations that want that's your 127th Of your current population, which is three percentish Jesus Christ yeah Basically population collapse happens fast So and seems to be accelerating in most parts of the world So so basically I mean for myself when I'm like This is the first time it's been possible to extend life you extend consciousness beyond Earth Maybe that window will be open for a long time, but it might only be open for a short time We should make sure that we make life multi planetary and make consciousness multi planetary while it's possible\"\"\"\n",
