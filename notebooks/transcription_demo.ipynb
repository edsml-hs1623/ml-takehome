Is it an unmanned voyage tomorrow's first? I'm Anne Fliedamores. The Earth and Mars will be synchronized every two years. Or every 26 months, technically. So the next orbital synchronization is November of next year. So, and you can launch plus minus a month roughly. So we'd have to launch in November or December of next year. And so the default plan is to launch hopefully several starships tomorrow at the end of next year. And what would they be doing? Well, at first we're just going to try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing. Do we do we succeed in landing? Like let's say we were able to send five ships to all five land intact or do we add some creators to Mars? If we add some creators, we've got to be put more courses about setting people. You know, we need to. So we're going to make sure the thing lands safely. How does it land on Mars? With on rocket thrusters. So it'll just land. We'll add legs. Okay. I'll just land and have legs in the air. So it'll be remote controlled from Earth. Or just autonomous autonomous completely. Mars is you can't remote control things from both because Mars. Mars is far. Yeah, it's too far. It's beautiful light constraints. So Mars at closest approaches roughly four light minutes. And when it's on the other side of the sun, it's about 12 light minutes. So you know, round trip would be like 40 minutes. Press case. If Mars is on the other side of the sun. So once you do that, then how long do you think before you start sending people up there? What we're going to try to go as fast as possible. You can think this is really. Erase against time. Can we make Mars self sufficient before. Civilization has some sort of. Future folk in the road where there's either like a war, nuclear war or something or a. We'll get hit by a meteor. Or simply, civilization might just die with a whimper in adult diapers instead of with a bang. I think we can do this and. Well, I don't know at least I think we've built within 15 earthmoss. Inconciliation event or you know, so it's like 30. Years. If we have an exponential increase in. If if every year, if every two years, we have like a major increase in. Number of people in town is tomorrow's. I think as a rough approximation, we need about a million tons of the so far as maybe a million people. That kind of thing to actually have a civilization. Yeah, that that would you terraform like what would you do you would eventually. Terrible moss at first people would live in some kind of protected environment like domes and underground. Kind of thing. Charafoing would take too long. I mean, we're at this point in time. Where. In the for the first time in the four and a half billion year history of earth. It is possible to extend consciousness beyond our home planet. And that window may be open for a long time or maybe open for a short time. I hope it's open for a long time. But it might only be open for a short time. And we just make sure that we extend the light of consciousness tomorrow. Before some. Before civilization. Either extinguishes or subsides. You know, all that and all that. Any's evidence that the technology level of Mars drops below. Or technology level of earth drops below what is necessary to send spaceships to Mars. So. If there's some really destructive war or like said some natural cataclysm. Or or simply the birth rate is so low that. You know, we we just like said die in adult diapers with a one per. That's one of the possible outcomes for a lot of countries ahead of that way. So Japan is right Japan. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, at at dangerously. Yeah, at current birth rates in three generations. Korea will be about 4% of its current size. That's insane. Yeah, maybe maybe even less than that. There are only at one third of placement rates. If you have three generations that one that's your one twenty-seventh. Of your current population, which is three percentish. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Basically population collapse happens fast. So. And seems to be accelerating in most possible. So basically, I mean, for my same one, I'm like. This is the first time it's been possible to extend life. You extend consciousness beyond earth. Maybe that went over you open for a long time. But I might only be open for a short time. We should make sure that we make life multi-planetary and make consciousness multi-planetary while it's possible.\n",

Well at first we're just gonna try to land on Mars and see if we succeed in landing Do we succeed in landing like let's say we were able to send five ships do all five land intact or do we? Add some craters to Mars If we add some craters we've got to be But more cautious about sending people, you know, and we need to So we're gonna make sure the thing lands Safely how does it land on Mars with on rocket's restors? So it'll just land. Oh, well add legs. Okay. Yeah, we'll just land and have legs and yeah, so It'll be remote controlled from Earth Or just autonomous autonomous completely Mars is you can't remote control things from both because Mars.
